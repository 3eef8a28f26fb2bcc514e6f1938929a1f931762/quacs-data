    "research": "I am currently focused on a book manuscript and journal articles drawing on my dissertation research, and starting up a lab at RPI conducting critical audience and user studies utilizing a data collection framework called Screenomics that collects screenshots from consenting participants\u2019 devices every few seconds for longitudinal studies. The lab will explore how the interweaving of data-driven social media platforms and mobile devices across categories of life and social action shapes users\u2019 construction of their digital lives and realities, and our broader political climate in turn. Immediate research areas include mediatized violence, particularly terrorism, and its circulation and reception in platform-centric mobile media environments, and far-right authoritarian subjectivization and conspiratorial discourses. Potential research avenues for students and future collaborators could include these areas as well as platform politics and governance, global comparative studies of mobile user cultures and mediatized violence and event construction. My dissertation, Mediatizing Terrorism: A Study of Audiences' Construction of Violent Events Under Datafied Capitalism, studied the circulation of transnational mobile media accounts of terror attacks in order to examine the intersection of violence, liberalism, and authoritarianism as it is transformed in the data-driven political economy of communication. The dissertation\u2019s central question asks: how is mediatized terrorism encountered, made sense of, and responded to by audiences in datafied media systems? To answer, I used screenomics to observe U.S. mobile media users\u2019 responses to a wave of ISIS terror attacks in Europe in the spring of 2017. These responses were captured unobtrusively every five seconds, affording examination of transnationally mediated accounts of terrorist attacks viewed on users\u2019 mobile devices across platforms and contexts using coterminous observation, revealing in fine detail how audiences truly use their mobile devices, platforms, and how they respond to attacks as they unfold. Based on this observation, I identified four mediatized rituals in response to terrorist attacks as they occur: one, a contingent of responses to terrorism in far-right ecosystems, assimilates attacks and unrelated social conflict into an imagined future of what liberal multiculturalism portends, creating the possibility for offline action stoking and reinforcing cycles of violence; the other three micro rituals comprise a limited suite of individualized responses to distant crises that are habituated by the data-driven political economy. My analysis stands in contrast to the dominant critiques of data-driven social media such as the de-ritualization of media and political polarization by highlighting both the persistence of media rituals as well as the distinct threat posed by ritual action in far-right mobile media specifically.\u200b",

The theory recognizes population-wide connected value cocreation among persons and organizations as a transforming mode of production for Knowledge Economy, and thereby analyzes new busness designs and service system design laws. A new model accompanies the theory: Hyper-Networks, which engages the emerging network science to provide insights into the analytic nature of connected value cocreation. New system design methods aim at helping scale IS up to the populations of customers, providers, and resources; down to individual users; and transformational to cross-sectional collaboration. The theory is also suported by such results as instrumentation of the environments (using, e.g., RFID systems, wireless sensor networks), Cyber-Infrastructure-Assisted Enterprises, and the market approach to open and scalable information exchange. He is a believer of person-centered models on the Internet. In addition to the above original work on serfvice science, Dr. Hsu is also devoted to studying sustainability design for products and production systems, and alternative energy system design for micro grids at the community level. The originator of the Metadatabase and Two-Stage Entity-Relationship Models, Dr. Hsu's work have contributed to much of the research on these topics as reported in this Web site, Enterprise Integration and Modeling. He has been a principal investigator of Rensselaer's Computer-Integrated Manufacturing and Adaptive Integrated Manufacturing programs, and a number of other government- and industry-sponsored projects. The sponsors include companies such as Alcoa, Digital, GE, GM, IBM, and Samsung Electronics, and government sources such as the U.S. National Science Foundation, Army Research, New York State, and NATO. Dr. Hsu teaches Multi-disciplinary Capstone Engineering Design, Discrete Systems Simulation, Databases, e-Business engineering, and Information Systems. His publications include a number of books and edited volumes, and over a hundred scholarly papers in a number of archivaljournals and proceedings. He is a member of AIS, IEEE and ASEE. He has served and continue to serve on the editorial board for several journals and organizations, including, e.g., IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.",

In between his long tenure at the Institute, Drew conducted postdoctoral research at MIT, and taught for two years at New York University. Drew works in the area of multiphase flows, which are flows in which more than one material moves. Applications include sedimentation, boiling filtration and separation. A common example of the latter is the separation of a carbonated beverage and its \u201chead\u201d. It is an exciting area because of the complexity which can occur in such flows, and also because the simplest set of equations you can write are \u201cill-posed\u201d \u2014 flawed in a very fundamental way. Even though the simplest equations are incorrect in this way, many predictions obtained from them appear believable. Should the right equations be very different from the wrong ones? To try to answer this question, Drew is examining solutions of the equations which represent special physical phenomena in the flows and how sensitive the predictions are to the equations. The physical phenomena include the formation and propagation of \u201cstructures\u201d in the flow, such as shocks and transitions, including the interface between the beverage and its foamy \u201chead\u201d. There are some deep physical questions encountered along the way. Specifically, one wants to know how the equations appear in different coordinate systems. Since coordinate systems are human inventions, the materials cannot know one from another. This gives information about the form the equations can take. Another question involves the concepts of entropy and disorder. The motion of liquid flowing around a bubble has a \u201cdisorder\u201d in it on the scale of the bubble size, but this is vastly different than the thermal motions usually treated with thermodynamic ideas. On the other hand, this \u201cdisorder\u201d associated with the motion cannot all be reordered, or recovered, without some expenditure of energy. Drew feels that results in this important technological area can give insights in other areas of mechanics, for example, in the relation between gas dynamics and the dynamics of a large collection of gas molecules.",

Dr. Schwendeman received promotions to associate professor with tenure and then professor, and was named the Head of the Department of Mathematical Sciences in 2012. Dr. Schwendeman's research focuses on the development and analysis of numerical methods for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise in applications of science and engineering. A significant portion of his work has centered around the development of numerical methods for systems of PDEs modeling wave phenomena in reactive and nonreactive flows. This work has included numerical studies of shock wave focusing and convergence, transonic and hypersonic aerodynamics, and multi-phase and multi-material high-speed reactive flow. In recent work, Dr. Schwendeman has developed a class of new numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction problems.

    "research": "The primary area of interest involves the physical phenomena of power system equipment. This embraces dielectric phenomena and high voltage technology, physical electronics, gas physics, and, more recently, the application of superconductivity to power apparatus and the development of nanodielectrics. As an experimentalist, Dr. Nelson is particularly interested in the development of computer-based diagnostic instrumentation for power plant (currently transformers and generators). Acoustic and optical methods; as well as artificial intelligence are often invoked in this arena. Computer numerical modeling of the physical processes involved is often an important element in this work. The involvement in high-voltage and transient phenomena also includes a strong interest in electrostatics. Interest has centered both on the understanding and mitigation of unwanted electrostatic effects (e.g. streaming electrification) and also on the utilization of electrostatics for such things as precipitators. Research Specializations Streaming Electrification and ECT in liquids Generator Insulation Diagnostics Ultrasonic interrogation of insulating structures Artificial intelligence applied to partial discharge analysis Development and application of nanodielctrics Superconducting quench phenomena Distributed generation and islanding issues Large scale computer modeling in connection with these activities. Since 2002, most of Professor Nelson's research activity has centered on the development of nanodielectrics as a new class of insulating materials. This activity is encapsulated in a new book entitled \"Dielectric Polymer Nanocomposites\" which was published by \"Springer-Verlag\" in early 2010.",

For some time, she has been investigating cultural perceptions of fact and fiction and is currently exploring their status within a political context. In Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), Deery demonstrates how reality television monetizes and consumes reality through its branding of content and propagation of capitalist narratives. Among other things, she examines the professionalization of individual identities and social relationships, the development of television as a social and interactive medium, and the commodification of viewers and TV participants. Reality TV (Polity, 2014) provides an overview of the impact of reality television since its inception and its contribution to discussions of gender, class, race, celebrity, audience agency, and consumer identity. The book also continues to explore cultural understandings of factuality and realism. Deery also co-edited (with Andrea Press) Media and Class: TV, Film, and Digital Culture (Routledge, 2017). In this collection, a range of prominent British and American scholars address topics such as class as entertainment, labor relations and media production, and digital celebrity.

    "research": "(Under construction) Astrobiology and the interface between Chemistry & Geology Definitions of \"Astrobiology\": Though the term 'astrobiology' contains the word 'biology', the field of study is not limited to only specimens that are themselves classified as living. Instead it is a broad and encompassing field involving many different disciplines and areas of research. A good description can be found through the University of Washington [ link ]: \u201cAstrobiology is the study of life in the universe. The search for life beyond the Earth requires an understanding of life, and the nature of the environments that support it, as well as planetary, planetary system and stellar interactions and processes. To provide this understanding, astrobiology combines the knowledge and techniques from many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, atmospheric science, oceanography and aeronautical engineering.\u201d Where the Johnson-Finn (PENGUIN) Group Fits in Astrobiology Research: Chemists, astronomers, and geologists at RPI follow a history of research in astrobiology and pre-biotic chemistry (the field of research exploring the types of chemistry that could have existed before life emerged). Science itself is an ever-evolving organism, adapting to new information, new techniques, and new problems in need of solutions. Currently, the newest evolution of astrobiology research at RPI is through RARE (Rensselaer Astrobiology & Research Education) Center. A collaboration between the departments of Earth & Environmental Science and Chemistry & Chemical Biology funded by NASA and RPI. Professor Johnson-Finn is a faculty member of the RARE Center and a Co-I of a NASA funded research grant involving collaborators across the country titled \"Earth First Origins\" (EFO). The EFO focuses on understanding the connection between geologic environments and the emergence of life through observations, modelling, and experiments. Link to RARE flyer Sitting at the junction of organic chemistry and geology, the Johnson-Finn group aims to answer relevant questions as to the roles that geology plays in the pathways of organic compounds through experiments. When the astrobiology community was asked in recent years to define goals and objectives for future research, \"Identifying abiotic sources of organic compounds\" and \"Synthesis and function of macromolecules in the origin of life\" topped the list. [ NASA Astrobiology ] The Johnson-Finn research group is focused on exploring the fundamental chemistry that is available to organic compounds in geologic settings, primarily the role that minerals (the simplest chemical component of rocks) play either as catalyst or reagent in aqueous organic reactions. Through a combination of hydrothermal experiments, electrochemical approaches, and thermodynamic modelling, reaction pathways for different classes of organic compounds can be traced in the formation of a larger organic chemical framework. Beyond Astrobiology / Exploring Problems on Earth Our laboratory is looking to pursue research questions beyond our astrobiology work, probing fundamental abiotic processes that exist anywhere in the universe or pivoting back to Earth to find solutions related to the larger environmental issues we face today. The fundamental approach provides a powerful starting position to comprehend and explore how different environments evolve at a molecular level. Students help to guide these questions and drive our understanding forward! Techniques of the Laboratory (Both Physical and Virtual) The PENGUIN laboratories (currently under renovation) will house experimental vessels that can explore different fundamental parameters related to aqueous organic reactions. The goal of all studies in this group will be to gather information about the kinetics and mechanisms of different organic reaction paths through either experimental or theoretical means. The combination of experimental expertise with theoretical guidance is most powerful. The three main approaches utilized in the group include (1) hydrothermal chemistry, (2) electrochemistry, and (3) thermodynamic modelling. Interested students will undertake projects using one or more of these techniques to pursue questions related to specific geologic, environmental, or experimental fields of study. Hydrothermal chemistry: Water that is hot (described as \"hydrothermal\") has different properties from the water that we observe at ambient conditions. The reaction paths for organic compounds, especially in contact with different mineral surfaces available in naturally occurring geologic settings, is in need of detailed chemical cartographers, looking to map these environments through experiment. To perform such experiments requires the use of high temperature and high pressure reaction vessels and experimental methods designed to withstand such conditions while keeping the reaction mixture intact. Electrochemistry: To observe redox reactions requires the ability to control and monitor the flow of electrons. Electrochemistry is a useful tool for exploring reactions that require the transfer of those electrons to proceed. Initial inspirations for this work involve the use of semiconductor minerals as catalytic drivers of organic redox reactions. How those reactions may occur at hydrothermal conditions, influence the available biosignatures observed on other planets, or be harnesses for the purpose of sustainable chemistry are all of interest and under pursuit by researchers in this group. Thermodynamic Calculations: The analytical chemist Izaak M. Kolthoff popularized the maxim inherited from his PhD advisor N. Schoorl: \"Theory guides; experiment decides.\" Thermodynamic tools such as CHNOSZ https://chnosz.net/ can help to guide different experimental and analytical research by providing insight into what might exist and what definitely does not exist from an energetics perspective. Involving programming, data management, and database building, these calculations serve as a solid foundation upon which experimental studied can thrive and expand. Laboratory facilities will be located in the 1st floor of the Cogswell Laboratory building.",

    "biography": "My research interests are time dependent. The reason is that I like mathematics, and I like to use mathematics to understand the world we live in (i.e., I am an applied mathematician). Here are two specific research topics of current interest: 1) Mechanoreception. This is the study of how a living organism senses and then recognizes mechanical stimuli. The mechanoreceptors that I am presently working on are in the auditory system and in skin. For example, the mechanisms through which skin transduces tactile stimuli from a mechanical to neural signal are not understood. Therefore, the goal of my research is to construct a mathematical model that describes this process. This project involves the study of the nonlinear deformation of skin, the analysis of the dynamics of the tactile receptor, and the study of the nonlinear diffusion associated with the electro-chemical processes in the nerve. 2) Sleep-Wake Cycle. The goal of this research project is to derive, and then analyze, a physiologically based model of the human sleep-wake cycle. The approach is to use the known properties of the neurotransmitters associated with wake and sleep, and the regions of the brain in which they function, to derive the model. This approach also incorporates, or accounts for, the states of sleep (REM and NREM) and the mechanisms that regulate it (homeostatic drive and circadian synchronization).

This includes an analytical evaluation of the relationship between seismic damage (repairs per kilometer of pipe) and ground strain, as well as numerical and centrifuge evaluation of buried pipe subject to abrupt PGD at a fault crossing or the margin of a lateral spread. The 1999 MCEER Monograph by O\u2019Rourke and Liu entitled \u201cResponse of Buried Pipeline Subject to Earthquake Effects\u201dprovide background information and a summary for the topic. An updated Buried Pipeline Monograph is expected early in 2011. Snow Loading on Roofs: * Ground Snow Loads * Drift loads on stepped roofs * Drift loads on gable roofs * Eave icing Snow and Ice Loads on Buildings: Snow loading is a structural design consideration for roofs in most states and the controlling load for at least some structural component in about half the states. Although not a significant load from a structural standpoint ice dams frequently lead to infiltration and costly water damage to interior walls and ceiling surfaces. Research on both issues is ongoing at Rensselaer. Of the many types of snow loads; uniform, sliding snow from a higher roof, etc drifted snow results in higher loads and more potential for structural damage. The Rensselaer water flume is being used to simulate snow drift loading and establish relationships for use in national codes. A guide explaining the ASCE 7-10 snow load provision through design examples and frequently asked questions has been published by ASCE Press.",

    "biography": "Professor Steven Cramer is the William Weightman Walker Professor of Polymer Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. His lab is currently conducting research on several areas related to protein-surface interactions and molecular bioprocessing. Many of the past contributions from Professor Cramer and his students to the field of Chromatographic Bioprocessing have had dramatic impacts on the state of the art of this technology and its successful implementation for the biomanufacturing of biological products. Their development of adsorption isotherm models of various classes of protein chromatography (in particular his steric mass action (SMA) model for ion exchange) have enabled the prediction of non-linear protein chromatographic behavior in a range of adsorption systems. These models have been widely employed in academic research and have been utilized worldwide by the biotechnology industry. Their invention of low molecular weight displacers for protein purification represented a paradigm shift in displacement chromatography and included several new modes of mass action and chemically selective displacement chromatography. Their development of a Quantitative Combinatorial Design (QCD) approach has resulted in the discovery of a range of novel displacers and affinity ligands. The Cramer lab was one of the first to employ high throughput screening (HTS) for developing chromatographic bioprocesses which has had a dramatic impact on the way bioprocess development in now carried out in the industry. Their work on the purification of antibodies using both protein A and mimetic resin systems produced a series of papers that had a major impact on the field of antibody purification. Prof. Cramer and his students also pioneered a new methodology for the a-priori prediction of protein binding in chromatographic systems from crystal structure which is now being incorporated by many biopharmaceutical companies for process development. The Cramer lab\u2019s multidisciplinary work using a combination of biophysics, molecular dynamics simulations and chromatography with protein libraries has provided significant insights into the design of novel multimodal chromatographic systems. Recent work on integrated biomanufacturing and expedited process development is having a dramatic impact on how bioprocess development is carried out in the industry. The Cramer lab is now actively involved in several gene therapy downstream biomanufacturing projects, continuous mRNA processing, and several big data modeling efforts. In addition to his focus on downstream bioprocessing, Professor Cramer is known worldwide for his expertise in separations in general. He served as the Editor-in-Chief of the International journal Separations, Science and Technology for 20 years. Professor Cramer has won numerous awards including the ACS National Award in Separations Science and Technology, the ACS BIOT Division\u2019s Michaels Award in the Recovery of Biological Products, and several awards from RPI including the Wiley Distinguished Faculty Award and the School of Engineering Outstanding Professor and Research Excellence Awards. In addition, he has been elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Chemical Society, and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. Cramer holds 11 patents and has published extensively in the top peer-reviewed journals in the field with 228 publications and an h index of 54 and 9007 citations. Importantly, the 55 Ph.D. graduates from the Cramer lab have had a significant impact with many of his former students now playing key leadership roles in the state of the art of industrial bioprocessing at most of the major biopharmaceutical and bioseparations companies worldwide as well as academia.",

    "biography": "Hello! I am a faculty member (Professor) of the Earth and Environmental Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Most of what I do academically falls within the realm of Geophysics. Geophysical observations and data analysis techniques are the most effective tools for determining what lies beneath the surface of the Earth. They can be applied at a spectrum of scales, from a few meters to thousands of kilometers, to address a variety of objectives from the detection of salt water invading an aquifer to fundamental questions about how the Earth works. My primary interests in both teaching and research center on the development and application of these geophysical techniques. We have ongoing research projects in a number of fields pertaining to geophysical data analysis and a substantial inventory of equipment for graduate and undergraduate use. We offer courses in field methods that include instruction in both the theory of geophysical data analysis and the application of this theory to problems in the real world. One of these courses is devoted primarily to the evaluation of groundwater problems such as the contamination of aquifers and the identification of buried channels. Others address larger scale problems such as the formation of basins in the western United States and the large mountain belts of central Asia. Among the techniques that we learn about and apply are potential field methods (gravity and magnetics), electrical methods (resistivity and electromagnetism) and seismologic methods (using both controlled sources and earthquakes) and modern surveying techniques using the Global Positioning System. Students are encouraged to become involved in the actual collection, reduction and interpretation of geophysical data. Over the past few years both undergraduate and graduate students have been involved in research projects directed at understanding collisional processes in Taiwan, the Pakistan Himalayas and the Tien Shan, in determining the motion of the Philippine Sea plate, in understanding the evolution of the Basin and Range, and the details of earthquake processes in California. They also have been involved in projects to map underground water channels in upstate New York, waste site evaluations and investigations for evidence of recent seismic activity on the borders of the Adirondacks.",

He's also modeled and processed large terrain databases, e.g., to compress, to compute hydrography and visibility, and to site observers, and compressed 5D environmental data sets. The algorithms are the fastest in their class. His current research hobby is designing and implementing small, simple, and fast data structures and algorithms for large geometric datasets. Note that efficiency in both space and time can become more important as machines get faster. This research is applicable to computational cartography, computer graphics, computational geometry, and geographic information science. He is now currently studying parallel CAD operations, such as overlaying 3D triangulations (tetrahedrulations). 3D-EPUG-Overlay is an algorithm for exactly computing the intersection (it can also compute general overlays) of pairs of 3D triangulated meshes. Each input mesh may represent a single solid or a more complex polygonal subdivision (representing multiple solids, each one identified by a label). 3D-EPUG-Overlay employs a combination of several techniques to ensure its correctness and efficiency. His last major NSF research project was to understand the mathematics of terrain. Another recent NSF project, together with Cutler and Zimmie, was analyzing how levees erode when overtopped, and testing models in a geotechnical centrifuge. Subprojects include compressing terrain while preserving slope, compressing multidimensional environmental data, and extending partial hydrological data to a complete and consistent river network. Another major project compressed and operated on terrain for DARPA/DSO/GeoStar. The operations included multiple observer siting and path planning. His longterm uneachable goal is to establish terrain modeling on a proper formal foundation that respects its physical properties.
